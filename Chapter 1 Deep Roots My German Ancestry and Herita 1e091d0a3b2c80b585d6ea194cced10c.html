            <p>
                In the opening chapter of my story, I explore the roots that shaped my identity.
                Growing up, I was always aware of my German ancestry. My parents came from
                German-American families who had spoken the language at home until World War II
                prompted them to stop to avoid suspicion. Yet our heritage persisted through family
                stories, surnames, and the older generation's occasional switch to German when they
                wanted privacy from young ears. Years later, DNA tests confirmed my predominantly
                European roots while revealing a surprising 1.7% Bedouin ancestry—an intriguing
                connection given my decades working with Arab communities.
            </p>

            <p>
                I once viewed my heritage simply as half Heuring and half Becker, but ancestry
                research uncovered a more complex legacy of sixteen distinct family lines, each
                contributing equally to who I am. This discovery highlighted the often-overlooked
                importance of one's maternal lineage. Heuring (herdsman) and Becker (baker) weren't
                just names but reflections of ancestral trades, with agriculture forming a common
                thread on both sides. My great-great-grandfather Andreas Heuring left Bavaria,
                Germany in 1867, settling in Otsego Township to establish his farm. Though his
                original house is gone, the one built by his son, my great-grandfather George
                David, still stands amid modern developments. Similarly, my great-grandfather
                Pius Becker immigrated from Baden in 1887, also drawn by Homestead Act promises,
                eventually owning two farms in Hassan Township near the Crow River dam.
            </p>

            <p>
                Though I grew up in town, my childhood was enriched by time on my uncles' farms—
                baling hay, riding a Shetland pony, and playing hide-and-seek among the sheds.
                These experiences fostered values of hard work, family bonds, and connection to
                the land deeply rooted in generations of agricultural life. St. Michael wasn't
                just my hometown but a pocket of faith, German tradition, and shared values,
                with the church, convent, and Catholic school at its centre.
            </p>

            <p>
                This heritage formed my foundation, remaining steady as I journeyed beyond
                Minnesota. Decades abroad, immersed in diverse cultures, never diminished my
                connection to that small-town grounding. The values shaped by rural life—family
                farms, close-knit community, and enduring German traditions—remained my anchor.
                No matter how far I traveled or how many years passed, my roots in German
                heritage and rural Minnesota remained an unshakable part of my identity.
