  <p>
    In the opening chapter of this story, I explore the roots that shaped my identity. Growing up,
    I was aware of my German ancestry. My parents came from German‑American families who had
    spoken the language at home until World II prompted them to stop to avoid suspicion.
    Yet our heritage persisted through family stories, surnames, and the older generation's
    occasional switch to German when they wanted privacy from young ears. Years later, DNA tests
    confirmed my predominantly European roots while revealing a surprising 1.7 % Bedouin ancestry—
    an intriguing connection given my decades working with Arab communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    I once viewed my heritage simply as half Heuring and half Becker, but ancestry research
    uncovered a more complex legacy of sixteen distinct family lines, each contributing equally to
    who I am. This discovery highlighted the often‑overlooked importance of one’s maternal lineage.
    Heuring (herdsman) and Becker (baker) weren't just names but reflections of ancestral trades,
    with agriculture forming a common thread on both sides. My great‑great‑grandfather Andreas
    Heuring left Bavaria, Germany in 1867, settling in Otsego Township to establish his farm.
    Though his original house is gone, the one built by his son, my great‑grandfather George
    David, still stands amid modern developments. Similarly, my great‑grandfather Pius Becker
    immigrated from Baden in 1887, also drawn by Homestead Act promises, eventually owning two
    farms in Hassan Township near the Crow River dam.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though I grew up in town, my childhood was enriched by time on my uncles' farms—baling hay,
    riding a Shetland pony, and playing hide‑and‑seek among the sheds. These experiences fostered
    values of hard work, family bonds, and connection to the land deeply rooted in generations of
    agricultural life. St. Michael wasn't just my hometown but a pocket of faith, German tradition,
    and shared values, with the church, convent, and Catholic school at its centre.
  </p>

  <p>
    This heritage formed my foundation, remaining steady as I journeyed beyond Minnesota. Decades
    abroad, immersed in diverse cultures, never diminished my connection to that small‑town grounding.
    The values shaped by rural life—family farms, close‑knit community, and enduring German traditions—
    remained an anchor. No matter how far I traveled or how many years passed, my roots in German
    heritage and rural Minnesota remained an unshakable part of my identity.
