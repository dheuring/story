    <div class="page-body">
      <p>Between 1979 and 1984, I pursued higher education and built the foundation for my career as an educator. After five years abroad, I returned to Minnesota with clear goals to build credentials that would support my family and launch an international career. After moving into my parents' basement in St. Michael, I completed prerequisites at North Hennepin Community College before transferring to the University of Minnesota, where I quickly earned 30 bypass credits for my Thai fluency. I completed a bachelor's degree in international relations with a minor in linguistics in just three years---while balancing the demands of new fatherhood after Joey's birth in 1981, a rigorous academic schedule, and part‑time teaching jobs to supplement the G.I. Bill.</p>

      <p>My homecoming highlighted family changes during my absence---my siblings had grown and some had married, with gatherings now centered on immediate rather than the extended Heuring and Becker families. My family's support proved invaluable---Dad helped purchase a car, Mom arranged for our marriage blessing at church, and my siblings welcomed Miam despite cultural and language differences.</p>

      <p>My acceptance into the University of Hawaii's graduate program unknowingly placed me in the nation's premier program for teaching English as a second language, which I had selected primarily for the tropical climate that I knew Miam would like. Learning from top‑notch professors like Dr. Jack C. Richards and Dr. Michael Long, I excelled in theoretical studies and teaching methodology, conducting research on revision strategies in second‑language writing that earned recognition. Our family thrived in Hawaii---Patti attended Head Start preschool, Joey played with neighborhood children, and Miam appreciated the Asian environment. We qualified for housing subsidies that made island living affordable, experienced a hurricane, and spent many days at the beach, including during a visit from my sister Sheila and her husband Randy.</p>

      <p>With my master's degree completed but student loans mounting despite our frugality, I discovered a pivotal opportunity: a teaching position in Saudi Arabia with the Raytheon Company paying $32,000 annually. This salary could quickly eliminate my debt, so I applied immediately, despite knowing little about Saudi Arabia or Raytheon. Once hired, we departed paradise. As our plane climbed upward with Hawaii and Diamond Head receding in the distance, I felt grateful. Graduate school had transformed that directionless young man in Thailand into someone with marketable skills, career direction, and a family depending on him---a foundation about to support unexpected adventures ahead.</p>
