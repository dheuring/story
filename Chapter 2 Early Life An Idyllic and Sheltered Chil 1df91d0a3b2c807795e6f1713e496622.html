      <p>I was born in Lansing, Michigan, in 1952, shortly after my father returned from service in the Korean War. My parents spent less than a year there, living in a trailer park while my father worked in a forge plant alongside his older brother. When I was nine months old, they moved back to Minnesota, renting a farmhouse just outside of St. Michael to leave urban life behind and reconnect with their roots in a close‑knit, German Catholic farming community.</p>

      <p>Growing up in 1950s St. Michael meant experiencing rural simplicity, deep‑rooted faith, and quiet financial struggle. My early years featured visits to family farms, extended family gatherings, and strong church connections. Life was modest. Dad operated a portable feed mill, traveling farm to farm, while Mom managed home life---eventually raising nine children with quiet strength and tireless devotion. Though money was tight, I rarely noticed as a child. Through faith and resourcefulness, my parents made ends meet---gardening, bargain‑hunting, and stretching every dollar.</p>

      <p>My childhood consisted of simple pleasures: outdoor play with neighbors, summer days helping Dad on farm routes, and regular church and parochial school attendance. Religion was so central that I considered becoming a priest, often conducting mock Masses in our basement. These early years built my moral foundation.</p>

      <p>Today's St. Michael has grown into a large sprawling town in transition, with new housing developments replacing woods and farmland. During my childhood, however, it remained firmly rooted in German heritage, with traditions, community bonds, and strong work ethic shaping daily life. These formative years---filled with joy, mischief, and character‑building moments---created the emotional and cultural foundation that would support me throughout life.</p>
