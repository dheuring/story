              <p>Retirement gave me a surprise second shot at being a dad---raising my daughter Anya in my late sixties and early seventies with the time and patience I just couldn’t give when work consumed my life. This part of my story has shown me that life’s most meaningful chapters often show up when you least expect them.</p>
			   
              <p>I’ve found real purpose in the everyday moments of raising Anya, even as I’ve had to figure out how to work around my body not being as young as it once was. Although spending my retirement years in Thailand had always been the plan, in 2023 we chose to relocate to suburban Minnesota for a few years, prioritizing what would be best for our long-term future.</p>
			  
              <p>While helping Alisa obtain U.S. citizenship was the initial impetus, the move has become much more meaningful than we anticipated. Living in Maple Grove has felt like coming full circle for me---returning to my roots after decades spent building a global career and raising a multicultural family across continents.</p>
			  
              <p>Readjusting to American life brought a blend of challenges and affirmations. It wasn’t health or cultural hurdles that demanded the most from us---it was adjusting to a changed America and rediscovering how we fit into it. The familiar rhythm of Midwestern life offered both comfort and contrast. Watching Anya thrive in her new surroundings affirmed our decision, even as we navigated a different national atmosphere than the one I remembered.</p>
			  
              <p>The most unexpected gift has been the revival of family ties once dulled by time and distance. Lakeside gatherings, family visits, and the annual Heuring reunion have helped Anya form real bonds with extended family and given me a chance to reconnect with my siblings and adult children. What began as a “we’ll just stay for three years” plan has grown into something far more meaningful as I reflect on the true meaning of home.</p>
			  
              <p>While Thailand remains where I ultimately see myself, the deepening bonds with family in Minnesota have brought rewards I never anticipated but now truly cherish. My retirement story isn’t concluding yet---it continues to take unexpected turns, reminding me that even in these later chapters, life offers new beginnings, surprises, and the unique joy of being Daddy Dave once again.</p>
